# CSS Interview Questions

## Easy Level Questions

1. **What does CSS stand for?**
   - CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is used to style and layout web pages.

2. **What is the purpose of CSS?**
   - The purpose of CSS is to control the presentation of HTML elements, including layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.

3. **How do you include CSS in an HTML document?**
   - CSS can be included in an HTML document using three methods: inline styles, internal styles (within `<style>` tags), and external styles (linking to a `.css` file using the `<link>` tag).

4. **What is a CSS selector?**
   - A CSS selector is a pattern used to select the elements you want to style. Examples include element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors.

5. **What is the difference between class selectors and ID selectors?**
   - Class selectors (e.g., `.classname`) can be used on multiple elements, while ID selectors (e.g., `#idname`) must be unique within a page and can only be used on one element.

6. **What is the box model in CSS?**
   - The box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements in the document tree, consisting of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content area.

7. **How do you center a block element horizontally?**
   - To center a block element, you can set its left and right margins to `auto`. Example:
   ```css
   .centered {
       width: 50%;
       margin: 0 auto;
   }
   ```

8. **What is the difference between `padding` and `margin`?**
   - `Padding` is the space between the content and the border of an element, while `margin` is the space outside the border of an element.

9. **How do you apply a background color to an element?**
   - You can apply a background color using the `background-color` property. Example:
   ```css
   .element {
       background-color: blue;
   }
   ```

10. **What is the purpose of the `z-index` property?**
    - The `z-index` property controls the stacking order of overlapping elements. Higher values are placed in front of lower values.

11. **How do you change the font size of an element?**
    - You can change the font size using the `font-size` property. Example:
    ```css
    .text {
        font-size: 16px;
    }
    ```

12. **What is a CSS pseudo-class?**
    - A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to selectors that specifies a special state of the selected elements. Examples include `:hover`, `:focus`, and `:nth-child()`.

13. **How do you create a CSS comment?**
    - CSS comments are created using `/* comment here */`.

14. **What is the difference between `inline`, `block`, and `inline-block` elements?**
    - `Inline` elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. `Block` elements start on a new line and take up the full width. `Inline-block` elements are similar to inline elements but can have width and height set.

15. **How do you apply styles to multiple classes in CSS?**
    - You can apply styles to multiple classes by separating them with commas. Example:
    ```css
    .class1, .class2 {
        color: red;
    }
    ```

## Intermediate Level Questions

16. **What is the `flexbox` layout model?**
    - The `flexbox` layout model is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in a container, allowing for flexible and responsive designs.

17. **How do you create a responsive design using media queries?**
    - Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the viewport size. Example:
    ```css
    @media (max-width: 600px) {
        .responsive {
            font-size: 14px;
        }
    }
    ```

18. **What is the `grid` layout model in CSS?**
    - The `grid` layout model is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex layouts using rows and columns.

19. **How do you create a CSS transition?**
    - CSS transitions allow you to change property values smoothly over a specified duration. Example:
    ```css
    .box {
        transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
    }
    .box:hover {
        background-color: green;
    }
    ```

20. **What is the `position` property in CSS?**
    - The `position` property specifies the positioning method for an element. Values include `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`.

21. **How do you create a CSS animation?**
    - CSS animations can be created using the `@keyframes` rule and the `animation` property. Example:
    ```css
    @keyframes example {
        from {background-color: red;}
        to {background-color: yellow;}
    }
    .animated {
        animation: example 4s;
    }
    ```

22. **What is the `overflow` property in CSS?**
    - The `overflow` property controls what happens when content overflows an element's box. Values include `visible`, `hidden`, `scroll`, and `auto`.

23. **How do you use CSS variables?**
    - CSS variables (custom properties) are defined using the `--` prefix and can be reused throughout the stylesheet. Example:
    ```css
    :root {
        --main-color: blue;
    }
    .element {
        color: var(--main-color);
    }
    ```

24. **What is the `calc()` function in CSS?**
    - The `calc()` function allows you to perform calculations to set CSS property values. Example:
    ```css
    .element {
        width: calc(100% - 20px);
    }
    ```

25. **How do you create a CSS sprite?**
    - A CSS sprite is a single image that contains multiple images. You can use the `background-image` property and adjust the `background-position` to display specific images.

26. **What is the `display` property in CSS?**
    - The `display` property specifies how an element is displayed on the page. Common values include `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `flex`, and `grid`.

27. **How do you implement a sticky element in CSS?**
    - A sticky element can be implemented using `position: sticky;` along with a `top` value to specify the offset from the top of the viewport.

28. **What is the `:nth-child()` pseudo-class?**
    - The `:nth-child()` pseudo-class selects elements based on their position in a parent element. Example: `li:nth-child(2)` selects the second `<li>` element.

29. **How do you create a responsive image in CSS?**
    - A responsive image can be created using the `max-width` property set to `100%`, ensuring the image scales with the container. Example:
    ```css
    img {
        max-width: 100%;
        height: auto;
    }
    ```

30. **What is the `box-shadow` property in CSS?**
    - The `box-shadow` property adds shadow effects around an element's box. Example:
    ```css
    .box {
        box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px gray;
    }
    ```

```
